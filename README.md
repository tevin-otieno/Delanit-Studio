## Author

**This website was created by yours truly Tevin Otieno On 4th September 2021**

## Description

The aim of this website was to test what we have learnt and to check the accomplishment that can be done  when we put the new technologies learnt to good use.

## Achievements

The achievements in havin to work with bootstrap and Jequery to make a responsive and mobile friendly website the experience is rather quick but the freedom of using pure css is the drawback.   

The sites end up looking generick and there is constrained creativity since you have to reffer to the bootstrap documentation for the works that they have done inorder to replicate it on your website.

## Technologies Used

This website was built purely by HTML5, CSS3, Jquery and Bootstrap code and ofcourse the images contained in the assets folder.
